    <h1>Request Batching with Caching</h1>
</div>

<p>
    This sample demonstrates how to use REST batching with caching. This is achieved by chaining both methods immediately before the action method, however order of these two methods
    does not matter as shown in the example. Any get requests that are part of a batch may be cached, and you can specify the per request caching paramters if needed. The results of 
    the batched call will then be cached as expected - even though they are part of the batch. For subsequent batches those requests which are cached will not be included, instead
    those promises will resolve immediately with the cached data.
