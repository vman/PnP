##Importing the code for use:##

Once you have downloaded the library the next step is including it in your project. Here are some examples using common techniques:

###SystemJS###

If you are using the [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) the following example shows how to load the library. It assumes you have already loaded SystemJS into the page.

```JavaScript
System.import('jquery').then(function ($) {
    System.import('path/to/pnp.js').then(function (pnp) {
        pnp.logging.write('My first log message!');
    });
});
```

###RequireJS (Or any AMD Compliant module loader)###

If you are using the [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) the following example shows how to load the library. It assumes you have already loaded RequireJS into the page.

```JavaScript
require(['jquery', 'path/to/pnp.js'], function($, pnp) {
    pnp.logging.write('My first log message!');
});
```

Once you have included the code in your application, start with the [pnp](pnp.md) object to see what you can do!
